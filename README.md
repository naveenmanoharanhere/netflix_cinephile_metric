# netflix_cinephile_metric
A data-driven framework to evaluate and rank Netflix films based on cinematic craftsmanship rather than popularity, genre, or engagement metrics.  This project introduces a Cinephile Excellence (CE) Score — a composite, explainable metric derived from aspect-based sentiment analysis of long-form film reviews using transformer models.
